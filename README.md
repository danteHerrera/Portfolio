## Why is it being made
  I'm making this portfolio to push myself to make clear an cohesive webpages. I started with a wireframe of how I want it to look, and now I am going to try to bring it to life. This will give me professional experience by understanding what a customer or user would expect of a web developer. I am going ot keep adding to this portfolio as my professional career begins in programming.
